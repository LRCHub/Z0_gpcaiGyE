Born from an egg
On a mountain top
The punkiest monkey
That ever popped
He knew every magic trick
Under the sun
To tease the Gods and everyone
And have some fun
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
<♪>
What a cocky saucy monkey
This one is
All the Gods were angered
And they punished him
Until he was saved
By a kindly priest
And that was the start
Of their piligrimage west
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
<♪>
With a little bit of
Monkey magic
You'll see fireworks tonight
With a little bit of
Monkey magic
Everything will be all right
<♪>
Born from an egg
On a mountain top
The punkiest monkey
That ever popped
He knew every magic trick
Under the sun
To tease the Gods and everyone
And have some fun
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
